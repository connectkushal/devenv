# devenv (WIP)
This is a package containing list, set of scripts, misc files or instructions for installing common softwares and tools I use, in a dev server or home system after a fresh os installation/upgrade.

Would appreciate any updates/improvements/suggestions

  - Define installation modes
    - apt, script, gzip, deb file, etc
