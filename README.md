# devenv (WIP)
This is a hobby project containing list of softwares, set of scripts, misc files or instructions for installing common softwares and tools I use, in a dev server or home system after a fresh os installation/upgrade.

I have used ansible in the past extensively and wish to develop something in go for my specific use case.

### TODO:
  - Define installation modes
    - apt, script, gzip, deb file, etc
    - define steps required for each mode of installation
  - Categorize softwares/tools based on installation modes.
    - write scripts for each steps in each mode of installation
  - Convert scripts to go and use go routines for tasks/steps where possible
